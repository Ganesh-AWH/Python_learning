Project Overview

This is a simple Hangman Game built using Python. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word letter by letter within a limited number of lives. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn using ASCII art. The game ends when the player either guesses the full word correctly or runs out of lives.

This project was created to practice and strengthen core Python concepts such as lists, loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and random number generation.
